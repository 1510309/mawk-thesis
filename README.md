Masterthesis - Predict a permanent magnet synchronous motor's components' temperature with LSTM/GRU recurrent neural networks using Chainer and particle swarm optimization.

This project is a fork of the chainer project (thats why it has so many contributors).
The framework was not altered though.

Hyperparameter optimization of the used recurrent neural networks was conducted by a self-implemented particle swarm optimization.
Moreover, it was automated on a computing cluster my university was providing (PCÂ²).
